This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# A web app for financial analysis
## Acces it [Here!](https://www.jamesjjlungu.com/finapp/home) for a demo!
## What is it?
This handy app utilizes multiple API calls to display information pertaining to a publically listed company. Stock price, stock history, metrics, and financial info; this app displays all of these and more in a simple, easy to master layout.
## What is the purpose of this project?
I was very unfamiliar with HTTP front-end API calls, so this project definitely made me comfortable with that. Financiall analysis is also a hobby of mine, and I really love to do it, so i figured why not combine two of my interests and code a little stock-lookup tool!
## What did I use?
Built with React.js, used Twitter Bootstrap v4. I utilized two api's, [Finnhub.io](https://www.finnhub.io) and [IEX Cloud](https://www.iexcloud.io)
## Why on earth did I use two APIs?
Because these APIs are very pricey, haha. I'm utilizing both APIs free-versions. I prefer Finnhub.io, as its docs are easier to navigate. But, they only allow be 30 API calls a minute :/.
